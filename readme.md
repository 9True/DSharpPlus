# DSharpPlus, version 6

DSharpPlus v6 is a ground-up rewrite of the library, focused on performance, modernity, maintainability and correctness.
Development of this version is occurring simultaneously with development of DSharpPlus v5, and is tracked on this branch,
while DSharpPlus v5 is tracked on the master branch.

## Licensing

DSharpPlus is based off DiscordSharp, whose license can be found [here](./DiscordSharp.LICENSE).

DSharpPlus, up to version 5.x, uses the MIT License, which can be found [here](./LICENSE-OLD)

DSharpPlus, starting with version 6.x, uses the Mozilla Public License, v2.0, which can be found [here](./LICENSE).
This version does not contain any code from previous versions, and is built from ground up.

Additionally, because DSharpPlus references LGPL libraries, single-file published distributions of applications using
DSharpPlus must in turn be licensed compatibly with LGPL. This is not applicable for undistributed applications or
applications distributed with multiple files, because only a single-file distribution is statically linked to LGPL
software and thus falls under the LGPL requirement of compatible licensing for statically linking code.
